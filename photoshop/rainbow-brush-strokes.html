<p>this is going to be a very simple tutorial, but it's one of the basic techniques i use for making abstract wallpapers</p>
<p>first, start a layer with <strong>filter -&gt; render -&gt; clouds</strong> with the default black and white colors on your toolbar:</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 1.png"><img title="Picture%201" alt="Picture%201" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 1.png" /></a></p>
<p>then, add two <strong>adjustment layers</strong>, first a <strong>curves</strong> and then a <strong>gradient map</strong>. the gradient can be whatever colors you want for the picture, in my example i went with the built-in <strong>spectrum</strong> rainbow gradient. next, adjust the curves layer so that your clouds map to as much of your gradient as possible</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 2.png"><img title="Picture%202" alt="Picture%202" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 2.png" /></a></p>
<p>then, <strong>flatten the image</strong> to commit the adjustment layers and use <strong>filter -&gt; blur -&gt; motion blur</strong> on your resulting layer. in this example we're gonna make vertical lines, so set the direction to <strong>90 degrees</strong> and crank the distance all the way up</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 3.png"><img title="Picture%203" alt="Picture%203" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 3.png" /></a></p>
<p>now, to add a bit more texture to it, create a new layer and use <strong>filter -&gt; render -&gt; clouds</strong> on it as well, set its blending to <strong>overlay</strong> with a very low opacity, like <strong>20%</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 4.png"><img title="Picture%204" alt="Picture%204" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 4.png" /></a></p>
<p>if you want to go an extra mile, a trick i like to use is <strong>filter -&gt; texture -&gt; patchwork...</strong>, exploiting the sweetspot in it where a square size of <strong>3</strong> makes the texture look less defined than in other settings. for my example i used a relief of <strong>2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 5.png"><img title="Picture%205" alt="Picture%205" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/rainbow-brush-strokes/Picture 5.png" /></a></p>
<p>and there you have it, using simple techniques like these you can make your own custom abstract wallpapers in no time!</p>
