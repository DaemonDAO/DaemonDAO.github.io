<p>this is a simple tutorial on how to turn text and other shapes into a neon sign!</p>
<p>first, we'll start with a blank document and the shape we want to turn into a neon sign. for this example i'm using simply the word "neon" in a fancy typeface.</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 1.png"><img title="Picture%201" alt="Picture%201" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 1.png" /></a></p>
<p>next, use the <strong>stroke</strong> layer style to create a thick layer, it doesn't matter what color. this will be the body of your neon sign. for my example, i used a thickness of <strong>12px</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 2.png"><img title="Picture%202" alt="Picture%202" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 2.png" /></a></p>
<p>once you have your outline, create a layer from the style (if you're using text, rasterize the type first). this will create a layer that is not only the stroke but also the full shape, which we don't want.</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 3.png"><img title="Picture%203" alt="Picture%203" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 3.png" /></a></p>
<p>to get rid of the shape, simply select the original shape layer (<strong>ctrl-shift</strong> or <strong>command-shift</strong> and then click on the layer) and delete the selection from the stroke layer, cutting it out. you can now delete the original shape layer.</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 4.png"><img title="Picture%204" alt="Picture%204" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 4.png" /></a></p>
<p>to help see the next steps better, fill your background with a dark color, but don't use pure black. here i'm using a very dark red (<strong>#1A0A0A</strong>). now that you can see the body of your neon sign contrasting against the background, use the eraser to cut parts of the outlines so you make open, single-stroke shapes, just like real neon lamps are. it can help to use an eraser the same size you used to make the stroke layer.</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 5.png"><img title="Picture%205" alt="Picture%205" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 5.png" /></a></p>
<p>now comes the fun part! open the layer styles for the neon outline and make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>color overlay:</strong> set this to pure white</li>
<li><strong>outer glow:</strong> change the blending to <strong>pin light</strong>, opacity <strong>100%</strong> and set it to the color you want your neon to be, then tweak the size. you don't want an ambient glow, just the bright shine a neon tube makes</li>
<li><strong>drop shadow:</strong> we'll make this into the ambient glow by changing the blending to <strong>screen</strong>, the color to the same you used in outer glow, distance to <strong>0</strong> and using a fairly large size and spread, until it "casts" onto the background. for my example i used size <strong>65px</strong> and spread <strong>12%</strong></li>
<li><strong>inner glow:</strong> this is used to give the body of the neon tube a feeling of depth. change blend mode to <strong>multiply</strong>, use a dark gray (<strong>#454545</strong>) and  <strong>30%</strong> opacity. change source to <strong>center</strong> and tweak the size until it becomes just a faint inner shadow on the tube. for my example i used <strong>16px</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>once you finish setting those styles, you should be left with something like this!</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 6.png"><img title="Picture%206" alt="Picture%206" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 6.png" /></a></p>
<p>and now that you have that done, you can even save the layer styles into your swatch for easy usage later.</p>
<p>to make our final image more interesting, we can give the background a bit more texture, like a brick wall. first, create a layer above your dark background and use <strong>filter -&gt; render -&gt; clouds</strong>, making sure your active colors are the default black and white. then, set the layer blending of the clouds to <strong>overlay</strong> and merge down with your background. finally, use <strong>filter -&gt; texture -&gt; texturizer...</strong> to give it more depth. for my 1024x768 picture, i used the <strong>brick</strong> texture at <strong>200%</strong> scale and a relief value of <strong>2</strong> to keep it subtle.</p>
<p><a href="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 7.png"><img title="Picture%207" alt="Picture%207" src="https://maple.pet/user/pages/08.photoshop/neon-signs/Picture 7.png" /></a></p>
<p>this technique is easy to adapt also for paths, if you use the <strong>stroke path</strong> function with a thick brush of choice in order to create the body of the neon lamp.</p>
<p>i hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and may your creations shine brightly!</p>
